        <center><b>The ClearBlade platform uses a secure scalable implementation of MQTT for messaging</b></center>
        <p>MQTT is a protocol on top of TCP that is lightweight -- making it the open standard for IoT communcations. It uses a publish/subscribe model centered around topics. A publish can occur on one topic, but a subscriber can be subscribed to many topics. Additionally, the are multiple quality of service (QOS) levels that can be applied to a published message. In this part, we will:
        <ul>
            <li>Get connected to ClearBlade's MQTT</li>
            <li>Subscribe to a topic</li>
            <li>Publish data in real time</li>
        </ul>
    </body>
